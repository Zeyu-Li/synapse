# synapse

Synapse is a tool that generates interactive graphs of course prerequisites and corequisites using data extracted from the UAlberta course catalogue.

# Requirements
* Extract data
     1. Install python-ldap (recommended use pre-built binaries)

## todo
1.  refactor
2.  use api if possible
3.  else automate and improve scraping
4.  group equivalent courses (create equivalence classes somehow)
5.  filter by stream? (engineering, honors, spec, etc) (E) should be easy to detect code for, but not sure about the rest.
